# # Tic-Tac-Toe-Java

## Problem Statement

Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
